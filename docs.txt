Advanced Face Recognition System — Complete Documentation

---

Project Overview

This system detects faces in an input image, aligns the detected faces, extracts advanced facial embeddings using a state-of-the-art ArcFace model, and then recognizes the identity of each detected face by comparing its embedding to a database of known faces.

It uses modern deep learning and computer vision techniques to achieve high accuracy and robustness. The system is modular, extensible, and suitable for industry-level applications.

---

1. Detection Module

File: detection/mtcnn_detector.py

- What it does:
  Detects faces in an image and returns bounding boxes (coordinates of faces) and key facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth corners).

- Technology:
  Uses MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network), a popular and fast face detector that outputs both bounding boxes and facial landmarks.

- Why MTCNN:
  Unlike older detectors like Haar cascades, MTCNN is deep learning-based and provides facial landmarks for precise face alignment.

- Inputs/Outputs:
  Input: RGB image (numpy array)
  Output: List of detected faces, each with:
    - box: [x, y, width, height]
    - keypoints: dict with locations of left_eye, right_eye, nose, mouth_left, mouth_right

---

2. Alignment Module

File: alignment/align_faces.py

- What it does:
  Rotates and crops the face so that the eyes are horizontal and the face is centered, improving embedding quality.

- Why alignment?
  Deep learning models like ArcFace expect faces to be normalized in pose and size. Aligning faces ensures the model gets consistent input.

- How alignment works:
  Uses the eye keypoints detected by MTCNN, computes the angle between eyes, rotates the image to make eyes horizontal, then crops a fixed-size box (160x160 pixels) around the eyes.

- Input:
  - RGB image
  - Facial keypoints (left_eye and right_eye)

- Output:
  - Aligned face image (numpy array) resized to 160x160

---

3. Embedding Module

File: embeddings/arcface_model.py

- What it does:
  Extracts a 512-dimensional face embedding vector from the aligned face image.

- Technology:
  Uses ArcFace, a state-of-the-art deep face recognition model developed by InsightFace. ArcFace embeddings are very discriminative, enabling robust recognition.

- How it works:
  - Input: aligned face image (160x160 RGB)
  - The model processes the image and outputs a 512-D vector that encodes unique facial features.
  - Embeddings are normalized (unit vectors) to help cosine similarity comparisons.

- InsightFace library:
  Provides pre-trained ArcFace models and tools to extract embeddings efficiently.

---

4. Recognition Module

File: recognition/recognize.py

- What it does:
  Compares the extracted embedding of an unknown face with a database of known embeddings to identify the person.

- Method:
  - Uses cosine similarity to compare embeddings. Cosine similarity measures how close two embeddings are in feature space.
  - The known embeddings are stored per person (multiple embeddings per person improve robustness).
  - If similarity > threshold (e.g., 0.5), the face is recognized as that person.

- Input:
  - Embedding of detected face
  - Dictionary of known person embeddings

- Output:
  - Name of the recognized person or "Unknown"

---

5. Utilities

File: utils/preprocess.py

- Basic helper functions like resizing images and converting color spaces (BGR <-> RGB), which are necessary because OpenCV uses BGR but deep learning models use RGB.

---

6. Backend API

File: backend/api.py

- Orchestrator:
  This is the main logic that ties everything together.

- Flow:
  1. Load known user embeddings from data/users folder at startup.
  2. For an input RGB image:
     - Detect faces with MTCNN
     - For each detected face:
       - Align the face
       - Get ArcFace embedding
       - Recognize the identity by comparing embeddings
       - Draw bounding boxes and labels on the image
  3. Return the annotated image and the recognized names.

- Why this separation?
  Modularizes each step to make the system easier to debug, extend, and improve.

---

7. Training (Optional Advanced Module)

File: training/train_triplet_model.py

- Placeholder to train your own ArcFace model or fine-tune it with triplet loss.

- ArcFace training is compute-intensive and typically done on GPUs with large datasets.

- Recommended to use InsightFace official training repo: 
  https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/recognition/arcface_torch

---

8. Frontend (Streamlit UI)

File: app.py

- Simple Streamlit app lets users upload an image.

- On button click, calls backend API to detect and recognize faces.

- Displays the original and annotated image, along with recognized names.

- Easy to extend for webcam input, video processing, or multi-image batch recognition.

---

9. Data Folder Structure

data/users/
 ├─ person1/
 │   ├─ img1.jpg
 │   ├─ img2.jpg
 │   └─ embeddings.npy   # Numpy array of embeddings for person1
 ├─ person2/
 │   ├─ img1.jpg
 │   ├─ img2.jpg
 │   └─ embeddings.npy
 └─ ...

- You should precompute embeddings of all images for each known person using the ArcFace embedding extractor.

- Store embeddings as .npy arrays for fast loading.

How to Precompute Embeddings for Known Users

Example script snippet:

import os
import numpy as np
import cv2
from embeddings.arcface_model import ArcFaceModel
from detection.mtcnn_detector import detect_faces
from alignment.align_faces import align_face

data_dir = "data/users"
arcface_model = ArcFaceModel()
for person in os.listdir(data_dir):
    person_dir = os.path.join(data_dir, person)
    embeddings = []
    for img_name in os.listdir(person_dir):
        if img_name.endswith('.jpg') or img_name.endswith('.png'):
            img_path = os.path.join(person_dir, img_name)
            img = cv2.cvtColor(cv2.imread(img_path), cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
            faces = detect_faces(img)
            if faces:
                aligned_face = align_face(img, faces[0]['keypoints'])
                emb = arcface_model.get_embedding(aligned_face)
                if emb is not None:
                    embeddings.append(emb)
    if embeddings:
        np.save(os.path.join(person_dir, 'embeddings.npy'), np.array(embeddings))
